Snowflakes
========================================

I originally encountered this small program in Antic magazine, a programming
magazine aimed at Atari computer enthusiasts, around 1984. That version was in
Basic and I was running an Atari 400 computer. 

As I got older and continued studying computers and programming, I rewrote
this program from memory (of what it looked like, not the specific implementation)
every time I encountered a new platform or language. 

Here it is in HTML 5 and JavaScript, which I am re-familiarizing myself with
as JavaScript (and projects like node.js and jQuery) has come a long way. This one
was a simple one, the one that presented the most challenge was GNU C and X11
running on a very early distribution (Slackware iirc) of Linux.

Overall I've found this exercise to be very useful as it tends to 
exercise most basic language features and has a graphic element which also makes
it applicable to learning new graphic APIs. I hope you enjoy it
as much as I have.
